The Microsoft AD service is built on actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you to synchronize or replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud. You can use standard Active Directory administration tools and take advantage of built-in Active Directory features such as Group Policy, trusts, and single sign-on. With Microsoft AD, you can easily joinAmazon EC2andAmazon RDS for SQL Serverinstances to a domain, and useAWS Enterprise IT applicationssuch asAmazon WorkSpaceswith Active Directory users and groups.",
